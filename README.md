<h1>#LWASP - A lightweight C# WebScript processor</h1>

LWASP is a webserver designed to make C# serverside great again. With the modern scripting style, with dynamic programming
and script tags that can fit everywhere in the page, PHP and NodeJS leave ASP.NET back in 2009, to eat it's own garbage.
Razor/MVC didn't help either, since its syntax is just unlovable, and no-one really likes it (well, at least I don't)

So, we came with LWASP to make C# a scripting language for the web. It's easy as one <@, two <@@ three <@@@!
<br/><ol>
<li>Code comes inside <@ @>. Printing is simple as Console.Write(), LWASP.Write(), echo() or print(). All of these work, just to make your printing experience perfect.
</li><li>You define methods (as static, of course) and classes inside <@@ @>.
</li><li>Using directives come inside <@@@ @>.
</li></ol><br/>

<b>Organized, simple, readable.</b>
